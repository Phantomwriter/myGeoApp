            			<strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br>
								Companies realize that social media can help promote their products by reaching a large audience without
								spending a penny. To this end, being able to quickly access a users information makes API resources invaluable.<br>
								Being able to seamlessly transfer user info through the various API’s out there gives giant advantages
								when drawing in and retaining users who just want a simple interface.<br>
						<strong>Login-</strong>By a user allowing their login information to be recorded, it allows companies<br>
								to track the users movements, likes, dis-likes and can make for a unique marketing tool when spreading
								a companies message. Companies can allow the same user login info to their site and make it simpler and 
								easier for users to move along.<br>			

						<strong>Payment-</strong>By storing users “payment type” data, companies make it easier for a user to <br>
								simply say yes to previously stored payment-type information to purchase goods and services. Eliminating the
								hassle of filling out billing information and credit card numbers every time increases the chance of a user 
								purchasing a product or service because it’s just easier for them.<br> 

						<strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong><br>
								When domains communicate with each other they follow the ‘Same Origin’ policy which prohibits their interaction 
								between each other. This is mostly for the purpose of security. Not allowing one domain affect another.<br>
								The usefulness of JSON-P in this instance allows a payload of JSON data to be transferred from one API to another.<br>
								The “P”, which stands for padding, is function that is “wrapped” around the data. This allows the self contained 
								function the ability to parse the data using javascript. Sending the information with a function allows any other 
								API the ability to render ANY JSON data because the function needed to display the data is already included.<br>

						<strong>JSON-P analogy</strong>
								JSON =a new un-assembled bike with assembly directions written in Chinese.<br>
								-P=is a Chinese speaking mechanic that’s included with the bike and assembles
								it for you so you don’t need to figure out how to read the directions.<br>
						<strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br>
								A few months ago President Obama signed an FAA bill that gives the go-ahead to draw up rules to integrate drones into 
								the country's airspace by October 2015. I had done some research and discovered a few companies that are capitalizing
								on this new trend by creating drones that can be controlled by smartphones.This would be an excellent example of how
								JSON-P could be useful. Having JSON data sent with the function calls included would make it easier for ANY smartphone
								to utilize it’s own native accelerometer to control a drones movements.<br>

						<strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong><br>
								I wanted to combine the camera and the compass/geolocation features to enhance my app titled "MyGeo".<br>
								It's an app that allows you to take a picture, then record your location. From any other location, you will
								then be able to find that same location following the guidance system and referring to the picture
								for help. My audience would be anyone who wanted to pick a location, take a picture of that location,
								then use geolocation and real-time compass headings to find that exact same location. Pass the information on to friends or
								anyone who wanted to be where you were.<br>
						<strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br>

								As I reflect on lessons learned in regards to the workflow of design and development, I can’t help but be
								tied to old constraints. Doing research on the effective implementation of code vastly differs from research
								that you would do on an essay or term paper.

								I’ve learned that along the path of understanding code and how to utilize it comes a wealth of information
								that offers many different angles and answers to the same problem. Sometimes there is no exact answer when
								researching code. When researching about history, science or politics, there is only one answer and much
								like a coder, the facts must be put together into a report that can be understood by everybody and can convey
								the thoughts of the writer. I’ve learned to try and adapt this mentality when writing effective code.<br>
								Being someone with a writing background and little coding experience, I’ve tried to implement systems
								that I already use into a tool that will help write more effective code.<br>

      					<strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can </strong> 
      					<strong>use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance).</strong> <br>
      							By customizing my html markup, I could easily insert a video component. 
      							I could insert and utilize video specific HTML markup. This would allow video to be inserted into my page, which would 
      							make access to the information on my site more accessible to a wider audience.I could also add captioning to a video through html.

						<strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what</strong> 
								are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong>
								One of the common frustrations seems to be not being able to access youtube with a screenreader. I’m not sure how you could fix this problem. 
								It seems that there’s an audio alternative when prompted, but when the page refreshes, there is still no audio accessible option. 
								The user would need to find an alternative that is more user friendly when it comes to visual or hearing impairment. 
								One could use these shortcomings to create a better video service like Youtube that provides better access with a more 
								effective screenreader for this medium.
						<strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>

								AT & T currently has a media kit containing two apps that assist with accessibility. It focuses mainly on the visually impaired. 
								The two cross-platform applications are called Mobile Speak and Mobile Magnifier.
								
						<strong>Mobile Speak</strong>-Is a basic screen reader app that guides the user through the interface using audio cues.

						<strong>Mobile Magnifier-</strong>This application allows the user to adjust their screen in a variety of ways including magnification and
								the adjusting of the color spectrum for better accessibility by the visually impaired
						<strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong>

								Freedom Scientific has developed a braille reader for the blind that interacts with your computer through Bluetooth. It’s an excellent 
								example of innovation in accessibility for the visually impaired.

								NCH software has a product called Debut. It is screen capture software designed to capture video from a variety of source and allows 
								that video to have things such as captions added to the videos.
								You can also add time stamps, change the color and burn directly to a dvd if need be. I can see how this would help in areas such as 
								education and training where the ability to make these adjustments would not only benefit the visually impaired, but also allow users 
								to convey thoughts and ideas in a way that plain text never could.
